# Image-search-Engin

Image Search Engine Project Description
The core features of this project encompass:

Search Form: The webpage will feature a search form equipped with an input box where users can input their desired keywords. This form serves as the trigger for initiating the image search.

Search Results: The search results section will dynamically showcase the images retrieved from the Unsplash API, aligning with the user's search query. Initially, 12 images will be displayed, with the page being cleared for each new search query.

Image Display: Search results will be presented as clickable image thumbnails. Each thumbnail will serve as a link to the high-resolution image on Unsplash, opening in a new tab upon click.

Pagination: To efficiently handle extensive result sets, a "Show More" button will be implemented. When activated, it will load and display the subsequent page of images retrieved from the Unsplash API.

Unsplash API Integration: This application will engage with the Unsplash API to fetch images in accordance with the user's search query. API requests will include the essential access key for authentication.
